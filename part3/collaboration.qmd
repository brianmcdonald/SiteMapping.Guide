# Collaboration
Throughout the development cycle of site maps, involving the stakeholders identified earlier in this guide is key to producing high quality, user-centered site maps. 

The main outputs of this workflow is the static PDF site map. However, in the process of making these - it is important to recognise the following products are also created: 

 - Aerial/ Satellite imagery of sites in which CCCM, shelter or other humanitarian activities are being carried out. 
 - Geodatabase containing data layers of shelters and other camp infrastructure
 - Site map Templates
 - GeoPDFs and PDF 

These are valuable information products which can be used by colleagues and other humanitarian actors to conduct thematic analysis as well as serve as an evidence base for advocacy, planning and decision making. More importantly, these products are tools to collaborate with stakeholders and actors on the ground to:

1. Verify and validate the information, 
2. Feedback and suggest modifications
3. Update the data when changes occur on the ground. 

Therefore, the manner in which this data is stored, presented and shared is crucial to both allow for and promote the use of site maps.

## Information and knowledge management
Strategy of site information management 
- save and share data with the CCCM cluster so their is longer term management of site data 
the CCCM cluster can play a role in facilitating this 

## Generating geoPDFs
In the previous section, we looked at exporting print layouts as GeoPDFs. GeoPDFs are PDFs with embedded georeferenced location information. 

## Reading and annotating geoPDFs
GeoPDFs can be imported into Avenza maps. The app uses the built in GPS in a tablet or smartphone to locate users when out of range of a network or internet connection. Users can mark points of interest, attach photos with exact location, and add annotations to existing features. 

## Gathering feedback and map iteration.
