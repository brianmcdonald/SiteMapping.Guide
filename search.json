    "text": "Welcome to SiteMapping.Guide, an online guidance for the production of site maps in humanitarian response. Site maps are a key resource at all stages of a camp lifecycle; from the site planning of empty or partially settled land; the coordination and management of services on a site; the development and improvement of a sites’ infrastructure; to the site closure/handover/decommissioning stage.\nThe aim of this guidance is fourfold:\nThe Site Mapping Guide provides a full step-by-step workflow to develop site maps. It also outlines key considerations and data protection risks associated with the management of drone captured imagery, as well as the responsible dissemination of related information products produced in the process.\nThis guide presents two different approaches to developing site maps. The first approach uses existing satellite imagery and the second uses drones to capture aerial imagery of sites when and where satellite imagery is not available or not suitable."

These can help inform which and how many sites need to be mapped. Humanitarian actors, especially those on the ground, will also feed into the iteration process of the site maps, in order to validate geographic information and keep the maps and the underlying data layers up to date.\nAuthorities. The authorities are a crucial interlocutor for approvals. In addition, their engagement can promote the use of the site maps in decision making processes. The participation of authorities in the site mapping process will also facilitate the handover and long term management of information, expertise and equipment, as well as support capacity development initiatives for future scenarios.\nLegal team.

    "text": "1.2 General Requirements\nDeveloping site maps typically requires the following:\n\n1.2.1 Personnel\nStaff with relevant skills and expertise. Support staff such as drivers and procurement support will also be needed. Depending on the number of sites and how quickly the site maps are needed, the site mapping team may need to be scaled up.\n\n\n1.2.2 Context\nThe security, political and regulatory environment play a large role in determining the approach to site mapping in a country but also whether or not the process is feasible at all. Identification of such challenges and potential risks is best done as early as possible to avoid wasting resources or to allow sufficient time to mitigate them.\n\n\n1.2.3 Time\nDeveloping site maps can be a time-intensive process, requiring prior consultations with various stakeholders, lead-time for procurement of equipment, travel time for site visits, time for collecting and processing the imagery, composing the site maps and collaboratively iterating and updating their content. These are important factors to consider when looking at the time frame of their intended use.\n\n\n1.2.4 Funding\nThere are a series of finanical costs involved in the development of site maps that need to be taken into account. Annex 4 provides a table with indicative figures for the purpose of costing a site mapping exercise.\n\n\n1.2.5 Hardware and Software\nDepending on the chosen approach, not all items in the below table will be required. Highlighted are items which are required regardless of the chosen approach:\n\n\n\nHardware\nSoftware\n\n\n\n\nLaptop\nQGIS (or other GIS software)\n\n\nDrone kit\nWedODM\n\n\nAndroid Tablet\nAvenza maps\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.6 Connectivity\nIn situations of sudden onset disasters, connectivity can be very challenging and quite often can lead to bottlenecks and delays. While connectivity requirements vary depending on the chosen approach, a minimum degree of connectivity should be assumed for the initial gathering the required geographic information and data layers."

Think about whether there are others applications outside of site mapping that you are in need of, such as drainage analysis, slope analysis, landslide risk analysis or vegetation cover analysis. Consider what area needs to be covered whilst bearing in mind that larger areas require longer flight times, more storage etc.\nYou should not be flying the drone above as many areas as possible to collect as many images as possible and then decide what to do with them.

    "text": "2.2 Conflict and Data Sensitivity\nDue to protection risks, the humanitarian use of drones in conflict settings is strongly discouraged. The term “dual-use technology” is commonly used to describe a technology with both civilian and military applications. With the rise of the use of drones for military use, there is a risk that the use of drones for humanitarian purposes in sites may be perceived as a security threat by the site population or cause trauma due to an association of drones with their military uses. In conflict settings armed actors or authorities are likely to perceive the flying of drones as both a security and informational risk. This means that the importation of drone equipment and/ or the request for flight approvals will likely be denied, or that their use in a site risk being perceived as a security threat. 1\nThere are key considerations to take into account when collecting, processing and sharing any type of data. These considerations determine the degree of sensitivity applied throughout the data life cycle and include:\n\nThe potential to harm data subjects and others;\nThe potential to discriminate;\nThe potential to harm IOM staff and individuals representing authorized third parties.\n\nIn addition to the data risks and concerns outlined in the IOM Data Protection Manual, there are additional specific concerns and risks associated with the use of drones.2\nOnce your flight area is identified, a risk-benefit assessment should be conducted prior to using drones. The assessment will evaluate the risks and benefits associated with collecting and processing drone captured imagery and determine whether flying a drone for the collection of aerial imagery is the best approach in your context."

Individuals must not be identifiable from captured images. Ensure that the flight settings (altitude, angle etc.) eliminates or reduces as much as possible the likelihood that the captured imagery may directly or indirectly identify an individual. If, by mistake, you collect images in which people can be identified, you should immediately delete them. However, if the image taken must really be used, you can either crop the image or blur the faces of people who could be identified. While collecting the data or shortly thereafter, check whether any of the images captured contains sensitive data and therefore should be deleted or otherwise removed from/made unrecognizable in the image (for example, a group of individuals that could be identified as part of a specific group, image of illegal crops or settlement)."

    "text": "3.1 Types of satellite imagery\nThere are different types of satellite imagery. The types of imagery generated from a satellite depends on the kind of image-capturing method (remote sensing technology) it uses: active or passive sensors. Active sensors emit radiation towards the Earth’s surface and collect the reflected radiation. Lidar and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) are both example of active sensors. SAR emits electromagnetic pulses whereas Lidar emits light pulses towards the Earth surface, both measuring the reflection. Passive (or Optical) sensors detect radiation naturally reflected from the Earth’s surface and are dependent on the day-night cycle.\nFor the purpose of site mapping, satellite imagery sourced using Optical satellites is most prevalent and useful (as these typically produce imagery with colour similar to how the human eye preceives color).\n\n\n\nSynthetic Aperature Radar(active) vs Optical(passive) sensors Source: ESMA Lisbon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote on Colour bands\n\n\n\nSatellites produce a range of different visual outputs. These visual outputs differ in their color combinations. Wavelengths detected by the satellites are translated into color bands then can combined to form an Index. This allows further analysis to be conducted. True-color images, as produced by Optical satellites and often used for mapping purposes, are a combination of the red, green and blue bands which results in an visual output similar to how we see color with our eyes. Other types of outputs include the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NVDI), which can be used to monitor changes in vegetation, or the False Color Infrared combination, which can be used in water detection during the heavy rain seasons or in the event of flooding."

The level of detail at such spatial resolution allows for small and individual objects to be identified. High resolution images are ideal for humanitarian aid applications, detailed mapping, urban planning, as well as infrastructure, forestry and agriculture monitoring. However, high-resolution imagery is expensive and as a result, less of it is openly accessible. For the purposes of creating site maps, high resolution imagery is preferable.\nLow to Medium resolution images are useful for understanding the bigger picture, whether that is looking at historical trends or deriving insights from spectral analysis.

Wind speed also has an adverse effect on drone flight. Both type and size influence the susceptibility of drones to wind. Smaller drones, such as the DJI Mavic Mini for instance, have a windspeed operating ceiling of approximately 18km/h. Clouds, if above the flight altitude can have a positive affect as they act as a giant soft-box scattering sunlight, but if they are rolling may cause inconsistencies with light exposure.

QGIS can open different file types: Vector files (which use points, line segments and polygon objects to identify geographic information), Raster files/images (which use cells/ pixels to represent geographic information), and Delimited text files (such as .csv file types). For example:\n\n\n\nData Layer Example\nFile Type\n\n\n\n\nAerial Imagery\nRaster file\n\n\nLocation of healthcare facilities or service providers\nVector file\n\n\nPopulation per block\nDelimited Text file\n\n\n\nMost publicly available geographic information datasets are projected in a world Coordinate Reference System (CRS) (WGS 84). When loading a layer projected in a whole world CRS, the layer will look slightly distorted in the workspace. Therefore, all layers need to be checked and projected where needed, according to the Project CRS set to the area of your site location. You can use the epsg.io database of coordinate systems to know the coordinate system you should be using for you context.\n\n\n6.2.2 Layers and elements of a site map\nThis guide is accompanied by a site map template which can be loaded into QGIS’s Print Composer.

If saving as a PDF, consider saving the layout as a GeoPDF by selecting ’Create Geospatial PDF (GeoPDF) in the export PDF settings (refer to Section 7: Collaboration for more on GeoPDFs)\n\n\n6.2.5 Saving the data layers and styles into a Geopackage\nData layers are saved on your local computer. However, to share all data files, it is recommended to compress these into a Geopackage. The QGIS project and all the data used in the project can be saved using the Package Layers tool and easily shared and stored as such for future use."
