    "text": "Welcome to SiteMapping.Guide, an online guidance for the production of site maps in humanitarian response. Site maps are a key resource at all stages of a camp lifecycle; from the site planning of empty or partially settled land; the coordination and management of services on a site; the development and improvement of a sites’ infrastructure; to the site closure/handover/decommissioning stage.\nThe aim of this guidance is fourfold:\nThe Site Mapping Guide provides a full step-by-step workflow to develop site maps. It also outlines key considerations and data protection risks associated with the management of drone captured imagery, as well as the responsible dissemination of related information products produced in the process.\nThis guide presents two different approaches to developing site maps. The first approach uses existing satellite imagery and the second uses drones to capture aerial imagery of sites when and where satellite imagery is not available or not suitable."

Depending on the number of sites and how quickly the site maps are needed, the site mapping team may need to be scaled up.\n\n\n1.2.2 Time\nDeveloping site maps can be a time-intensive process, requiring prior consultations with various stakeholders, lead-time for procurement of equipment, travel time for site visits, time for collecting and processing the imagery, composing the site maps and collaboratively iterating or updating their content. These are important factors to consider when looking at the time frame of their intended use.\n\n\n1.2.3 Hardware and Software\nDepending on the chosen approach, not all items in the below table will be required. Highlighted are items which are required regardless of the chosen approach:\n\n\n\nHardware\nSoftware\n\n\n\n\nLaptop\nQGIS (or other GIS software)\n\n\nDrone kit\nWedODM\n\n\nAndroid Tablet\nAvenza maps\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.4 Connectivity\nWhile connectivity requirements vary depending on the chosen approach, some degree of connectivity should be assumed as needed. In situations of sudden onset disasters, connectivity can be very challenging and quite often can lead to bottlenecks and delays.\n\n\n1.2.5 Funding\nThere are a series of finanical costs involved in the development of site maps that need to be taken into account. Annex 4 provides a table that can provide indicative figures for the purpose of costing a site mapping exercise.\n\n\n1.2.6 Context\nThe security, political and regulatory environment play a large role in determining the approach to site mapping in a country but also whether or not the process is feasible at all. Identification of these challenges and risks is best done as early as possible to avoid wasting resources or to allow sufficient time to mitigate them."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Figure 2.1: Uses and challenges of drone use  Source: ICRC\n\n\nThere are two approaches to making sites maps presented in this guide. The main differerence between the two is in how aerial imagery is obtained:\n\nUsing high-resolution satellite imagery.\nUsing drones to capture aerial images of the site.\n\nEach of these approaches have pros and cons and it is important to evaluate each approach against the following criteria before assessing which approach to take in your context:\n\n\n2.0.1 Information needs\nIt is important to be clear on what images you want to collect and for which specific purpose. Consider whether you only need an image/orthomosaic or a Digital Elevation Model, 3D model, NDVI index etc. as this will affect your flight plan. Think about whether you have any applications outside of site mapping such as drainage analysis, slope analysis, landslide risk analysis, vegetation cover analysis etc. Consider also what area needs to be covered, bearing in mind that larger areas require longer flight times, more storage etc.\nYou should not be flying the drone above as many areas as possible to collect as many images as possible and then decide what to do with them. The data collection must be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose (only the needed data is collected).\n\n\n2.0.2 Conflict and Data Sensitivity\nDue to protection risks, humanitarian use of drones in conflict settings is strongly discouraged. The term “dual-use technology” is commonly used to describe a technology with both civilian and military applications. With the rise of the use of drones for military use, there is a risk that the use of drones for humanitarian purposes in sites may be perceived as a security threat by the site population or cause trauma due to an association of drones with their military uses. In conflict settings armed actors or authorities are likely to perceive the flying of drones as both a security and informational risk. This may mean that importation of equipment or flight approvals are not likely to be granted, or that their use in a site risk being perceived as a security threat. Your flight area must be specified prior to commencing the use of the drones. If unsure about your area of interest, please contact DOE for further guidance.\nThere are key considerations to take into account when collecting, processing and sharing any type of data. These considerations determine the degree of sensitivity applied throughout the data life cycle and include:\n\nthe potential to harm data subjects and others;\nthe potential to discriminate;\nthe potential to harm IOM staff and individuals representing authorized third parties.\n\nIn addition to the data risks and concerns outlined in the IOM Data Protection Manual, there are additional specific concerns and risks associated with the use of drones.1\nOnce your flight area is identified, a risk-benefit assessment should be conducted prior to using drones. The risk-benefit assessment will evaluate the risks and benefits associated with collecting and processing drone captured imagery and determine whether flying a drone to collect aerial imagery data is the best approach for your context.\n\n\n2.0.3 Data security/responsibility\nThe use of drones to capture aerial image for site mapping does not require the collection of personal data. Individuals must not be identifiable from captured images. Ensure that the flight (altitude, angle etc.) eliminates or reduces as much as possible the likelihood that imagery captured may directly or indirectly identify an individual. If, by mistake, you collect images in which people can be identified, you should immidiately delete them. However, if the image taken must really be used, you can either crop the image or blur the faces of people who could be identified. While collecting the data or shortly thereafter, you should check whether some of the data collected is particularly sensitive and should be deleted or otherwise made unrecognizable in the image (e.g. a group of individuals that could be identified as part of a specific group, image of illegal crops or settlement).\n\n\n2.0.4 Regulatory environment\nIt is important to fully understand the national and local-level laws, procedures and norms related to the use of UAVs as it can vary significantly between contexts. The regulatory enviroonment can refer to import procedures and restrictions; limitations on size and types on drones; pilot qualification requirements; and geographic limitations for UAV flight.\nThe Global Drone Regulations Database keeps an updated collection of country-specifc relations, and can be used to understand the sources of legal information, relevant contact information and regulations on operating rules, licensing and approval procedures. 2\n\n\n2.0.5 Organizational requirements\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote for IOM staff\n\n\n\nDuring the planning phase, it is important that IOM stuff reach out to IOM’s Office of Legal Affairs (LEG) leg@iom.int They provide legal an compliance guidance as well as the latest version of the Drone usage checklist and Risk-benefit analysis template.\n\n\nMany organization have internal rules and guidance governing the use of technologies such as Drones. Donors may also have their own rules around their uses and the use of data resulting from the exercise. During the planning stage its important to contact the relevant organisation focal-point to ensure compliance with these rules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIOM Data Protection Manual↩︎\nDroneRegulations.info launched by the UAVatiors network in 2014, is a database of national-level UAV regulations.↩︎"

    "text": "3.1 Types of satellite imagery\nThere are different types of satellite imagery. The types of imagery generated from a satellite depends on the kind of image-capturing method (remote sensing technology) it uses: active or passive sensors. Active sensors emit radiation towards the Earth’s surface and collect the reflected radiation. Lidar and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) are both example of active sensors, SAR emitting electromagnetic pulses and Lidar emitting light pulses towards the Earth surface and measuring the reflection. Passive (or Optical) sensors detect radiation naturally reflected from the Earth’s surface and is dependent on the day-night cycle. For the purpose of site mapping optical sources, which typically produce imagery with colour reprduction similar to the human eye, are most prevalent and useful."

For example, ESA’s Sentinel and NASA/USGS Landsat data provide historical data at this resolution.\nHigh resolution images are ideal for small scale analysis or monitoring since often a smaller area if covered. The level of detail at such spatial resolution allows from small and individual objects to be identified which makes it ideal for humanitarian aid applications, detailed mapping, urban planning, as well as infrastructure, forestry and agriculture monitoring. However, high-resolution imagery is expensive and as a result less of it is openly accessible.For the purposes of creating site maps, high resolution imagery is preferable."
