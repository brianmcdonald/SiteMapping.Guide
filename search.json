    "text": "Last updated: 1st November 2022\nWelcome to SiteMapping.Guide, an online guidance for the production of site maps in humanitarian response. Site maps are a key resource at all stages of a camp lifecycle; from the site planning of empty or partially settled land; the coordination and management of services on a site; the development and improvement of a sites’ infrastructure; to the site closure/handover/decommissioning stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThis guidance is in draft-stage, much of the content is missing and its structure may be subject to change.\n\n\nThe aim of this guidance is fourfold:\n\nOpen up the process of developing site maps to more humanitarian actors and profiles as well as mainstream site mapping skills and reduce reliance on a limited pool of specialized profiles.\nIncrease the speed at which site maps are developed. The shorter the lead time for creating site maps, the more useful they are for planning activities and coordinating partners in site, especially in sudden onset contexts.\nScale the availability of site maps to increase their benefit to reponses in a wider number of sites as well as in a wider number of countries.\nEncourage the creation of consistent site map products, in terms of visuals, quality and process that are affected population-centric and that adhere to data responsibility and safeguarding standards.\n\nThe Site Mapping Guide provides a full step-by-step workflow to develop site maps. It also outlines key considerations and data protection risks associated with the management of drone captured imagery, as well as the responsible dissemination of related information products produced in the process.\nThis guide presents two different approaches to developing site maps. The first approach uses existing satellite imagery and the second uses drones to capture aerial imagery of sites when and where satellite imagery is not available or not suitable.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Diagram of the workflow presented in this Site Mapping Guide  Source: IOM\n\n\n\n\nWhile no strict definition of a site map exists, this guidance considers site maps to be physical or electronic maps of IDP displacement sites that use imagery (aerial or satellite), along with the tracing and labelling of infrastructure (current or planned) as a tool for planning, coordination and risk analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nInfographics or maps, which focus on needs or activity/output-level indicators are, for the purpose of this document, considered as Site Profiles rather than Site Maps and lie beyond the current scope of this guide.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis guide is for any Camp Coordination Camp Management, Shelter, or assessment actor, working in humanitarian contexts, requiring site maps to do site planning, camp coordination or risk analysis and working at either agency or inter-agency level. While some prior knowledge of GIS software is beneficial for those who plan to use this guide, it is not a prerequisite. We hope that the steps documented in the below chapters are sufficient in detail and clarity for first-time users and will accompany new and experienced site mappers through the process of making site maps, from creating and visualising spatial data to exporting and disseminating standardized site maps.\n\n\n\nSite maps can illustrate camp settings in both sudden-onset disasters as well as protracted emergencies. They can be used to support the following activities:\n\nSite planning during suddent onset emergencies.\nSite planning for site improvements.\nAssessmets for site improvements for disability and inclusion, GBV and fire hazard risk mitigation.\nCamp coordination at the site level amongst service providers and setting up of essential site infrastructure and camp services.\nCCCM coordination at the cluster level.\nGBV/ Protection Safety Audits conducted through direct observation, key informant interviews, focus group discussions.\n\n\n\n\nThis guide was developed by IOM, with considerable, inputs, support and feedback by many experts in fields such as site planning, GIS, CCCM and GBV. Financial support for this guide was generously provided by United States Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (BPRM) through the Safe From the Start Initiative. A full list of names of those who contributed or support to this guide can be found in the acknowledgements annex.\n\n\n\nMany of the approaches and software/hardware tools are quickly evolving and improving. As such, we consider this guide to be a living document. If you have any suggestions on how we can improve this guide, please reach out to majones@iom.int and bmcdonald@iom.int."

Humanitarian actors, especially those on the ground, can also feed into the iteration process of the site maps, to validate information and keep the maps and underlying data up to date.\n**Authorities*.** The authorities are a crucial interlocutor for approvals as well as the use of the maps and handover of expertise and equipment in the case of capacity development for future scenarios.\nLegal team IOM Legal colleagues will provide any additional guidance on data collection, processing and sharing related to your specific context and are responsible for providing the final approval on the use of drones."

    "text": "1.2 General Requirements\nDeveloping site maps typically requires the following:\n\n1.2.1 Personnel\nStaff with relevant skills and expertise, as well as support staff such as drivers and procurement support will be needed. Depending on the number of sites and how quickly the site maps are needed, the site mapping team may need to be scaled up.\n\n\n1.2.2 Time\nDeveloping site maps can be a time-intensive process, requiring prior consultations with various stakeholders, lead-time for procurement of equipment, travel time for site visits, time for collecting and processing the imagery, composing the site maps and collaboratively iterating or updating their content. These are important factors to consider when looking at the time frame of their intended use. ### Hardware and Software Depending on the chosen approach, not all items in the below table will be required. Highlighted are items which are required regardless of the chosen approach:\n\n\n\nHardware\nSoftware\n\n\n\n\nLaptop\nQGIS (or other GIS software)\n\n\nDrone kit\nWedODM\n\n\nAndroid Tablet\nAvenza maps\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Connectivity\nWhile connectivity requirements vary depending on the chosen approach, some degree of connectivity should be assumed as needed. In situations of sudden onset disasters, connectivity can be very challenging and quite often can lead to bottlenecks and delays.\n\n\n1.2.4 Cost\nThere are a series of costs involved in the development of site maps that need to be taken into account. Annex 4 provides a table that can provide indicative figures for the purpose of costing a site mapping exercise.\n\n\n1.2.5 Context\nThe security, political and regulatory environment play a large role in determining the approach to site mapping in a country but also whether or not the process is feasible at all. Identification of these challenges and risks is best done as early as possible to avoid wasting resources or to allow sufficient time to mitigate them."

    "text": "Uses and challenges of drone use  Source: ICRC ```\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Uses and challenges of drone use  Source: ICRC\n\n\nThere are two approaches to making sites maps presented in this guide. The main differerence between the two is in how aerial imagery is obtained: 1. Using high-resolution satellite imagery. 2. Using drones to capture aerial images of the site.\nEach of these approaches have pros and cons and it is important to evaluate each approach against the following criteria before assessing which approach to take in your context:\n\n2.0.1 Conflict and Data Sensitivity concerns\nThere are key considerations to take into account when collecting, processing and sharing any type of data. These considerations determine the degree of sensitivity applied throughout the data life cycle and include:\n\nthe potential to harm data subjects and others;\nthe potential to discriminate;\nthe potential to harm IOM staff and individuals representing authorized third parties.\n\nIn addition to the data risks and concerns outlined in the IOM Data Protection Manual, there are additional specific concerns and risks associated with the use of drones.\nDue to protection risks, humanitarian use of drones in conflict settings is strongly discouraged. The term “dual-use technology” is commonly used to describe a technology with both civilian and military applications. With the rise of the use of drones for military use, there is a risk that the use of drones for humanitarian purposes in sites may be perceived as a security threat by the site population or cause trauma due to an association of drones with their military uses. In conflict settings armed actors or authorities are likely to perceive the flying of drones as both a security and informational risk. This may mean that importation of equipment or flight approvals are not likely to be granted, or that their use in a site risk being perceived as a security threat. Your flight area must be specified prior to commencing the use of the drones. If unsure about your area of interest, please contact DOE for further guidance.\nOnce your flight area is identified, a risk-benefit assessment should be conducted prior to using drones. The risk-benefit assessment will evaluate the risks and benefits associated with collecting and processing drone captured imagery and determine whether flying a drone to collect aerial imagery data is the best approach for your context.\n\n\n2.0.2 Data security/responsibility\nThe use of drones to capture aerial image for site mapping does not require the collection of personal data. Individuals must not be identifiable from captured images. Ensure that the flight (altitude, angle etc.) eliminates or reduces as much as possible the likelihood that imagery captured may directly or indirectly identify an individual. If, by mistake, you collect images in which people can be identified, you should immidiately delete them. However, if the image taken must really be used, you can either crop the image or blur the faces of people who could be identified. While collecting the data or shortly thereafter, you should check whether some of the data collected is particularly sensitive and should be deleted or otherwise made unrecognizable in the image (e.g. a group of individuals that could be identified as part of a specific group, image of illegal crops or settlement).\n\n\n2.0.3 Regulatory environment\nIn many contexts, permissions to fly Drones is required. In some cases, a remote pilot license many also be needed.\n\nAdd Global Drone Regulations Database\n\n\n\n2.0.4 Information needs\nIt is important to be clear on what images you want to collect and for which specific purpose. Consider whether you only need an image/orthomosaic or a Digital Elevation Model, #D model, NDVI index etc. as this will affect your flight plan. Think about whether you have any applications outside of site mapping such as drainage analysis, slope analysis, landslide risk analysis, vegetation cover analysis etc. Consider also what area needs to be covered, bearing in mind that larger areas require longer flight times, more storage etc. You should not be flying the drone above as many areas as possible to collect as many images as possible and then decide what to do with them. The data collection must be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose (only the needed data is collected).\n\n\n2.0.5 Organizational requirements and final checklist\nOnce you have completed a risk-benefit assessment, identified your flight area, sought permission from local authorites and the affected communities have been informed, the below checklist should be completed and sent to leg@iom.int for final approval.\nThe following checklist aims to ensure that all ethical and data protection considerations have been addressed. Note that this is not an exhaustive list and more considerations might be needed for your specific context or organization. For IOM users, please send any questions on data protection and any data sensitivity concerns to leg@iom.int.\nTrainings: Ensure that the IOM drone operator(s) have received sufficient training to be able to fly a drone in a secure way ensuring appropriate data collection and data protee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsideration\n\n\n\n\nRisk-Benefit Assessment  Have you conducted a risk-benefit assessment to determine whether flying a drone to collect aerial imagery data is the best approach for your context? Is the use of drones necessary and justified? Have you considered whether there are any associated risks for in-country IOM staff or employees of the local authorities?\n\n\nData Collected  Are you clear about the specific purpose of the image collection? Is the imagery data relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose?  Have you taken necessary precautions and measures to ensure you are not collecting personal data? Are any individuals identifiable from the captured images?\n\n\nFlight Area  Have you clearly identified your flight area?\n\n\nTechnology  Is the technology that will be used of high standards? (UAV equipment, the image data storage system used, laptop, tablets etc.) Is the equipment safe, secure and appropriate to acheive the specific purpose.\n\n\nData Transfer, Sharing and Access controls  Do you plan to transfer any of the data to a third party outside IOM (e.g. for the third party to provide assistance or to do further analysis on the data) or share the drone captured imagery, location data, GIS files, final site maps? If so, have you contacted LEG for further advice. Additionally, have appropriate access controls been ensured? i.e. not all IOM staff should have access to the UAV’s imagery and not all should have the right to edit or delete it. You may also contact ICT to coordinate, as needed, to ensure appropriate data security.\n\n\nTrainings \n\n\nLogos/ Branding  The mission, in coordination with state authorities and HQ, should decide how the UAVs should be marked (e.g. IOM logo? No logo because of security considerations? Something else?)\n\n\nApprovals/ Permissions  Firstly, familiarise yourself with national legislation on required permissions and approvals needed to fly drones in your area of interest. Make sure you are not in breach of that legislation. In most contexts, an approval/ permission is needed by state or provincial authorities.  Secondly, the specific communities above which the UAVs will be flyinf should be informed. This is to avoid annoyance, complaints, and mitigate any concerns or fears that may be associated with an unexpected drone presence. The people living in these communities should have information on who is flying is flying the drone and why. Ideally, they should also have IOM (or your respective organisation)’s contact details in case they have questions or wish to raise a concern. The authorities might also inform them on your behalf.  Thirdly, additional approvals might be needed from the UN or by ICAO depending on your context.\n\n\n\n… 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 7 of ICRCs Handbook on data protection in humanitarian action examines the use of drones and remote sensing.↩︎"

    "text": "There are different types of satellite imagery. The types of imagery generated from a satellite depends on the kind of image-capturing method (remote sensing technology) it uses: active or passive sensors. Active sensors emit radiation towards the Earth’s surface and collect the reflected radiation. Lidar and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) are both example of active sensors, SAR emitting electromagnetic pulses and Lidar emitting light pulses towards the Earth surface and measuring the reflection. Passive (or Optical) sensors detect radiation naturally reflected from the Earth’s surface and is dependent on the day-night cycle."

    "text": "3.3 Understanding spatial resolution\nResolution of an image is categorized as follows: - High resolution: 30cm-5m/pixel - Medium resolution: 10-30m/pixel - Low resolution: over 60m/pixel\n10m resolution means that each pixel represents a 10m x 10m area on the ground.The smaller the spatial resolution, the higher the level of detail.\nDepending on the users needs, different image resolutions are used.\nLow to Medium resolution images are good for understanding the bigger picture, whether that is looking at historical trends or deriving insights from spectral analysis. For example, ESA’s Sentinel and NASA/USGS Landsat data provide historical data at this resolution.\nHigh resolution images are ideal for small scale analysis or monitoring since often a smaller area if covered. The level of detail at such spatial resolution allows from small and individual objects to be identified which makes it ideal for humanitarian aid applications, detailed mapping, urban planning, as well as infrastructure, forestry and agriculture monitoring. However, high-resolution imagery is expensive and as a result less of it is openly accessible.For the purposes of creating site maps, high resolution imagery is preferable."
