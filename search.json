Site maps are a key resource at all stages of a camp lifecycle; from the site planning of empty or partially settled land; the coordination and management of services on a site; the development and improvement of a sites’ infrastructure; to the site closure/handover/decommissioning stage.\nThe aim of this guidance is fourfold:\nThe Site Mapping Guide provides a full step-by-step workflow to develop site maps. It also outlines key considerations and data protection risks associated with the management of drone captured imagery, as well as the responsible dissemination of related information products produced in the process.\nThis guide presents two different approaches to developing site maps. The first approach uses existing satellite imagery and the second uses drones to capture aerial imagery of sites when and where satellite imagery is not available or not suitable."

These can help inform which and how many sites need to be mapped. Humanitarian actors, especially those on the ground, will also feed into the iteration process of the site maps, in order to validate geographic information and keep the maps and the underlying data layers up to date.\nAuthorities. The authorities are a crucial interlocutor for approvals. In addition, their engagement can promote the use of the site maps in decision making processes. The participation of authorities in the site mapping process will also facilitate the handover and long term management of information, expertise and equipment, as well as support capacity development initiatives for future scenarios.\nLegal team.

    "text": "1.2 General Requirements\nDeveloping site maps typically requires the following:\n\n1.2.1 Personnel\nStaff with relevant skills and expertise. Support staff such as drivers and procurement support will also be needed. Depending on the number of sites and how quickly the site maps are needed, the site mapping team may need to be scaled up.\n\n\n1.2.2 Context\nThe security, political and regulatory environment play a large role in determining the approach to site mapping in a country but also whether or not the process is feasible at all. Identification of such challenges and potential risks is best done as early as possible to avoid wasting resources or to allow sufficient time to mitigate them.\n\n\n1.2.3 Time\nDeveloping site maps can be a time-intensive process, requiring prior consultations with various stakeholders, lead-time for procurement of equipment, travel time for site visits, time for collecting and processing the imagery, composing the site maps and collaboratively iterating and updating their content. These are important factors to consider when looking at the time frame of their intended use.\n\n\n1.2.4 Funding\nThere are a series of finanical costs involved in the development of site maps that need to be taken into account. Annex 4 provides a table with indicative figures for the purpose of costing a site mapping exercise.\n\n\n1.2.5 Hardware and Software\nHardware requirements must include: a laptop (with sufficent processing power, RAM and storage); the drone kit (drone, remote, batteries etc.); a smartphone (for use as a controller); ground-control points (printout or spray paint). It is optional but advised to also have tablets, to support usage of the maps and any connected data collection exercised.\nSoftware requirements include: QGIS (or similar such as ArcGIS); WebODM (or similar such as PIX4D); DJI Fly mobile app; Dronelink mobile app (or similar for flight planning); Avenza Maps (or similar, for geoPDF usage) 1\n\n\n1.2.6 Connectivity\nIn situations of sudden onset disasters, connectivity can be very challenging and quite often can lead to bottlenecks and delays. While connectivity requirements vary depending on the chosen approach, a minimum degree of connectivity should be assumed for the initial gathering the required geographic information and data layers.\nIf using satellite imagery sufficent connectivity to download the imagery is required, or alternatively all map development can be done remotely with feedback from within country. Connectivity also affects the UAV imagery workflow as limited connectivity will require the use of offline tools only and for all processing of the imagery to be done locally. In areas with good connectivity, the imagery can be transferred to remote tools and computers for processing, allowing for a higher degree of remote support."

    "text": "2.1 Information Needs\nIt is important to be clear on what images you want to collect and for which specific purpose. Consider whether you need only an image/orthomosaic or whether you are look to create a Digital Elevation Model, a 3D model, a NDVI index etc. as this will affect your flight plan. Think about whether there are others applications outside of site mapping that you are in need of, such as drainage analysis, slope analysis, landslide risk analysis or vegetation cover analysis. Consider what area needs to be covered whilst bearing in mind that larger areas require longer flight times, more storage etc.\nDepending on the purpose and audience of the map, it is important to capture the site’s surroundings in order to situate it within its wider context. You should not map only within the boundaries of the site and where possible, you should try to include neighbouring host community settlements, transport linkages and other key infrastructure facilities, potential hazards or environental vulnerabilities in the area.\nYou should not be flying the drone above as many areas as possible to collect as many images as possible and then decide what to do with them. The data collection must be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to its purpose (only collect data which is needed)."

    "text": "2.2 Conflict and Data Sensitivity\nDue to protection risks, the humanitarian use of drones in conflict settings is strongly discouraged. The term “dual-use technology” is commonly used to describe a technology with both civilian and military applications. With the rise of the use of drones for military use, there is a risk that the use of drones for humanitarian purposes in sites may be perceived as a security threat by the site population or cause trauma due to an association of drones with their military uses. In conflict settings armed actors or authorities are likely to perceive the flying of drones as both a security and informational risk. This means that the importation of drone equipment and/ or the request for flight approvals will likely be denied, or that their use in a site risk being perceived as a security threat. [^footnote]\nThere are key considerations to take into account when collecting, processing and sharing any type of data. These considerations determine the degree of sensitivity applied throughout the data life cycle and include:\n\nThe potential to harm data subjects and others;\nThe potential to discriminate;\nThe potential to harm IOM staff and individuals representing authorized third parties.\n\nIn addition to the data risks and concerns outlined in the IOM Data Protection Manual, there are additional specific concerns and risks associated with the use of drones.1\nOnce your flight area is identified, a risk-benefit assessment should be conducted prior to using drones. The assessment will evaluate the risks and benefits associated with collecting and processing drone captured imagery and determine whether flying a drone for the collection of aerial imagery is the best approach in your context."

Ensure that the flight settings (altitude, angle etc.) eliminates or reduces as much as possible the likelihood that the captured imagery may directly or indirectly identify an individual. If, by mistake, you collect images in which people can be identified, you should immediately delete them. However, if the image taken must really be used, you can either crop the image or blur the faces of people who could be identified. While collecting the data or shortly thereafter, check whether any of the images captured contains sensitive data and therefore should be deleted or otherwise removed from/made unrecognizable in the image (for example, a group of individuals that could be identified as part of a specific group, image of illegal crops or settlement)."

Additionally, in the first days of an emergency, exisiting maps or preliminary spatial data on a site may not be digital (for example only photocopies of printed documents from local authorities or hand drawn maps may be available). In such cases, producing site maps with a high level of accuracy can be challenging.\nWhilst low accuracy maps should not be used to conduct risk analysis such as flooding or fire hazards and cannot be used for activities such as site planning, they can still be used in for coordination purposes or as tools for focus group discussions.\nWhilst there are some issues and limitations to translating and integrating hand drawn maps into GIS environments, existing printed or hand drawn maps should be digitized by redrawing features to create georeferenced spatial data layers in a GIS environment. Verifying the resulting data layers in the field can help mitigate these limitations and improve the accuracy of the digital map. One approach is to coordinate a walk-around the site where participants check and annote the map using Avenza maps (more of this in 7.2).\nIf neither of the above options are available and depending on the intended use of the site map and the level of accuracy required for that activity, maps of the site can be hand drawn onto large surfaces by either experienced site planners or members of the affected population and digitized at a later stage when needed."

    "text": "3.1 Types of satellite imagery\nThere are different types of satellite imagery. The types of imagery generated from a satellite depends on the kind of image-capturing method (remote sensing technology) it uses: active or passive sensors. Active sensors emit radiation towards the Earth’s surface and collect the reflected radiation. Lidar and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) are both example of active sensors. SAR emits electromagnetic pulses whereas Lidar emits light pulses towards the Earth surface, both measuring the reflection. Passive (or Optical) sensors detect radiation naturally reflected from the Earth’s surface and are dependent on the day-night cycle.\nFor the purpose of site mapping, satellite imagery sourced using Optical satellites is most prevalent and useful (as these typically produce imagery with colour similar to how the human eye preceives color).\n\n\n\nSynthetic Aperature Radar(active) vs Optical(passive) sensors Source: ESMA Lisbon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote on Colour bands\n\n\n\nSatellites produce a range of different visual outputs. These visual outputs differ in their color combinations. Wavelengths detected by the satellites are translated into color bands then can combined to form an Index. This allows further analysis to be conducted. True-color images, as produced by Optical satellites and often used for mapping purposes, are a combination of the red, green and blue bands which results in an visual output similar to how we see color with our eyes. Other types of outputs include the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NVDI), which can be used to monitor changes in vegetation, or the False Color Infrared combination, which can be used in water detection during the heavy rain seasons or in the event of flooding."

The level of detail at such spatial resolution allows for small and individual objects to be identified. High resolution images are ideal for humanitarian aid applications, detailed mapping, urban planning, as well as infrastructure, forestry and agriculture monitoring. However, high-resolution imagery is expensive and as a result, less of it is openly accessible. For the purposes of creating site maps, high resolution imagery is preferable.\nLow to Medium resolution images are useful for understanding the bigger picture, whether that is looking at historical trends or deriving insights from spectral analysis.

    "text": "4.2 Pre-flight\nPrior to the flight, consider the following: 1\n\nWeather: Most drones are not waterproof and therefor it is important to check precipitation forecasts in the flight area of interest. Wind speed also has an adverse effect on drone flight. Both type and size influence the susceptibility of drones to wind. Smaller drones, such as the DJI Mavic Mini for instance, have a windspeed operating ceiling of approximately 18km/h. Clouds, if above the flight altitude can have a positive affect as they act as a giant soft-box scattering sunlight, but if they are rolling may cause inconsistencies with light exposure. If possible, it’s best to fly around the middle of the day, when the sun is overhead, to limit shadows in the imagery.\nStakeholder engagement: Assuming regulatory processes have already been followed. Its important that the population in the site area of interest is fully informed and understands the plannedactivity, that there is acceptance of the activity and that theres a communication channel in place for the community to voice any complaints or feedback.\nHardware checks: Make sure that all batteries are charged and that all required equiments is functioning.\nPre-identify takeoff and landing sites: A suitable area will be free of obstructions such as trees or overhead wires and away from move foot or road traffic.\nCreate a flight plan: This includes the planned route, with altitude, overlap and takeoff/landing areas pre-programmed.\n\n\n4.2.1 Nadir vs oblique images\nThe image captured when a drones camera faces directly down is called a nadir image. For creating an orthomosaic of a site, nadir images are preferred to oblique images which are more suited to tasks such as 3D modelling.\n\n\n\nAn example of an oblique angle image of Bakassi Camp, northeastern Nigeria Source: IOM\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of a nadir angle image of Wau PoC, in South Sudan Source: IOM\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Ground control points\nGround control points are marks created on the site as reference points to match specific points on the image to specific coordinates within the site. They provide a great degree of accuracy for the image that relying on the GPS of the drone by itself.\nUse a minimum of 3 GCPs and capture the coordinates of each GCP centrepoint with a Phone or handheld GPS for an accuracy level of 1-3 metres. For accuracy of 1cm a specialised Real-time kinematic positioning (RTK) kit is required.\n\n\n\nAn example Ground Control Point Source: Pix4d\n\n\n\n\n4.2.3 Path and image overlap\nA minimum of 16-31 images are needed to create an orthophoto from drone captured imagery with WebODM. Images should averlap by 70-72%.\n\nMinimum number of images captured: 16-32\nMinimum image overlap: 70-72%\nMinimum image overlap for 3D: 83%\n\n\n\n4.2.4 Flight altitude\nGround Sampling Distance (GSD) refers to geographic area represented by one pixel of an image. It reflects the resolution of the image, with flight height and image sensor resolution being the two biggest determining factors. For site mapping a GSD of 2.5cm2 - 1cm2 is the range most suitable. Most flight planning software automatically calculate the GSD based on an entered flight altitude. The flight altitude should also consider potential flight obstructions such as trees or overhead power lines, noise and also privacy as having a flight altitude and GSD that is too low could result in the unintended consequence of capturing information that could be personally identifiable.\n\n\n\nGSD is the amount of actual ground captured by the distance between the center point of two adjacent pixels.

    "text": "6.2 Working in GIS\nGIS software can open different file types: Vector files (which use points, line segments and polygon objects to identify geographic information), Raster files/images (which use cells/ pixels to represent geographic information), and Delimited text files (such as .csv file types). For example:\n\n\n\nData Layer Example\nFile Type\n\n\n\n\nAerial Imagery\nRaster file\n\n\nLocation of healthcare facilities or service providers\nVector file\n\n\nPopulation per block\nDelimited Text file\n\n\n\n\n6.2.1 Loading data layers and veryfying projections\nTo prepare the site map, load the data layers into a GIS workspace, such as QGIS.\nMost publicly available geographic information datasets are projected in a world Coordinate Reference System (CRS) (WGS 84). When loading a layer projected in a whole world CRS, the layer will look slightly distorted in the workspace. Ensure that the Project CRS is set to the area of your site location. You can use the epsg.io database of coordinate systems to know the coordinate system you should be using for you context. All loaded data layers need to be checked and projected where needed, according to the project CRS.\n\n\n6.2.2 Layers and elements of a site map\nThis guide is accompanied by a site map template which can be loaded into QGIS’s Print Composer. Below is a dummy example of a site map produced using this template.\n\n\n\nAn example of a dummy site map composed in QGIS using the site map template included in this guide. Source: IOM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of supporting a standardized approach to the production of static site maps, and ensuring new site maps can be compared and used alongside existing maps, the template provided in this Site Mapping Guide is one approach to laying out a site map, however this can and should be adapted based on the context and it’s audience.\n\n\nThe following list of layers and elements can be included in the final output:\n\nTitle and Subtitle (1)\n\nCountry\nState\nSite Name\nThematic Title\nDate site map was last updated\n\nSite map audience/ permission/ sharing restrictions (1.2)\nProduction date and version number of site map (1.3)\nAgency/ NGO Logos (1.4)\nInset maps (2)\n\nAt Country/ Regional level\nAt Regional/ Area level\n\nNotes (3)\n\nData sources\nSatellite Imagery source\nImagery Resolution\nCoordinate system\nSite GPS coordinate points\nAgency/ NGO Logo\nContact\nLink to Geodatabase/ corresponding data layers\nDisclose limitations regarding accuracy of site map (3.1)\n\nMap\n\nBase Map (satellite/ aerial imagery) (4.1)\nScale bar (4.2)\nOrientation indicators (4.3)\nLegend (4.4)\nCamp Infrastructure (4.5) :\n\nShelters\nShelter blocks\nZones\nWASH facilities\nWater points\nEducation facilities\nHealth Facilities\nDistribution points (Food/ NFI)\nMarkets(s)\nInformation desks\nCFM desks\nOther camp facilities\nMovement network (Roads, pathways)\nCommunity areas/ centre\nReligious buildings/ spaces\nSite Entrance(s)\nSite boundary\nSecurity facilities or guard points\nFences/ Camp Boundaries\n\n\nEnvironment\n\nHost community\nGreen belt\nTrees/ Vegetation\nAgricultural land\n\nOptional additional labels:\n\nFunctioning/ non-functioning facilities\nMale/ female latrines\nUnusable area\nAgency responsibility for each section of the site\nShelter numbers/ Addressing\nSummary information/ figures\n\nSite population (households and individuals)\nSite area\nTotal no. of shelters\nShelter type and size\nQuantity of sanitation blocks/ latrines/ showers\nType of water supply\nTotal no. of water points\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.3 Visualizing data layers\nOnce the files are opened in QGIS, they will appear as layers. These layers can be duplicated in order to show different visualisations of the same file.\n\n\n6.2.4 Adding fields and editing attributes\nShapefiles (ESRI Shapefile format) are the most common type of vector file. This file format dataset consists of several files. Of these different files, there are two which you should be familiar with for the purposes of this site mapping exercise. First, the .shp file, which contains the geometries of the features in the layer and secondly, the .dbf file, which contains the feature attributes.\nThe attribute table interface allows you to view and [edit the attribute data] (https://docs.qgis.org/3.22/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_vector/attribute_table.html#editing-attribute-values) as well as interact with features in a layer (by selecting or filtering features for example). Fields are columns of attribute values and these can be added, deleted and edited through this interface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nAny saved changes made to a data layer in QGIS will also change the source file. If you wish to edit/ delete or add features or attribute values to a layer but do not want to edit the original source file, save the layer as a separate file before making your edits. Additionally, removing a layer will remove it from the work space but will not delete it from your source folder.\n\n\n\n\n6.2.5 Print Layouts and Using Templates\nWith QGIS’s layout composer, you can create layouts or use existing layout templates. The template file can be downloaded here. Once the layout is complete, save and export the print layout as an image, an svg (for future editing in other software such as Adobe Illustrator or InkScape, select export as vectors), or as a PDF. If saving as a PDF, consider saving the layout as a GeoPDF by selecting ’Create Geospatial PDF (GeoPDF) in the export PDF settings (refer to Section 7: Collaboration for why you should export your site map alsp as a GeoPDFs)\n\n\n6.2.6 Saving the data layers and styles into a Geopackage\nData layers are saved on your local computer. To facilitate sharing geographic information, data layers can be compressed into a Geopackage. The QGIS project and all the data used in the project can be saved using the Package Layers tool and easily shared and stored as such for future use."
