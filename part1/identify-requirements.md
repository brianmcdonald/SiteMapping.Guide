# Identifying requirements
Before jumping into to flying drones and developing site maps, it's important to first consider the following steps:
1. Clarify if site maps are required and what decisions they will inform.
2. Understand what stakeholders are to be involved, both from the perspective of using the maps, for example; CCCM actors or local authorities, and from the perspective of those who will be involved in their creation; affected population; local and national authorities, staff. Ensuring buy in from these stakeholders both on the development and use of these maps is crucial.
4. Identify general requirements to producing site maps. Regardless of the planned approach, development of site maps requires an investment of personnel, time, hardware, software, and connectivity. A shortcoming on any of these may affect the feasibility or schedule for the site map creation.
5. Identify red-line contextual challenges, risks or sensitivities that may affect the overall feasibility or appropriateness of developing site maps.

## Stakeholders
While it is somewhat approach-dependent, typically will involve the following stakeholders:
- Affected population is sites, who need to be consulted before imagery collection, to make sure they are informed, consent to the activity and to avoid any risks or misunderstandings.
- Humanitarian actors, who can feed into the design process and the process of prioritization of which and how many sites to visit.
- Authorities, who are an important interlocutor for approvals as well as the use of the maps and handover of expertise and equipment in the case of capacity development for future scenarios

## General Requirements
Producing site maps, typically require the following ingredients:
### Personnel
Staff with sufficient expertise skills will be needed, along with support staff such as drivers and possibly procurement. Depending on how many sites, or how quickly they are needed, the site mapping team may need to be scaled up.
### Time
Producing site maps can be a time-consuming process, requiring many prior consultation, lead-time for procurement of equipment, travel time for site visits, and time for processing imagery, development of the maps and iterating and updating their content. These are important factors to consider when looking at the timeframe of their intended use.
### Connectivity
While connectivity requirements will vary, based on the chosen approach, some degree of connectivity should be assumed as needed. In situations of sudden onset disasters, connectivity can be very challenging and quite often can lead to bottlenecks and delays.
### Cost
Annex 4 provides a table that can providing indicative figures for the purpose of costing a site mapping exercise. 

## Context
The security, political and regulatory environment play a large role in determining the approach to site mapping in a country but also whether or not the process is feasible at all. Identification of these challenges and risks is best done as early as possible to avoid wasting resources or to allow sufficient time to mitigate them.
