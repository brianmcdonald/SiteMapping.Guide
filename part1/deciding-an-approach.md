Uses and challenges of drone use *Source: ICRC*

The two most common approaches to obtaining imagery for use in site maps are:
1. Using high-resolution satellite imagery.
2. Using drones to capture aerial photography above the site.

Each of these approaches have pros and cons and it is important to evaluate each approach on the following criteria before deciding which approach to take in your context:

## Conflict and data sensitivity concerns
.... [^footnote1]
Using drones for humanitarian use in conflict settings is strongly discouraged, due to the following risks:
- Protection risks: The term "dual-use technology" is commonly used to describe a technology with both civilian and military applications. With the rise of the use of drones for military use, there is a risk that the use of drones for humanitarian use in sites may be perceived as a security threat by the site population or cause trauma due to an association of drones with their military uses. 
In conflict settings armed actors or authorities are likely to perceive the flying of drones as both a security and informational risk. This may mean that importation of equipment or flight approvals are not likely to be granted, or that their use in a site risk being perceived as a security threat.

## Information needs
TODO
- Do you just need an image/orthomosaic or do you need a DEM, #D model, NDVI index etc.
- Do you have applications outside of the site mappings, such as drainage analysis, slope, landslide risk analysis, vegetation cover analysis. 
- Whats the area that needs to be covered - large areas require more storage, longer flight times etc.333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333
