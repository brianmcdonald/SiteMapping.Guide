# UAV imagery

Once you have understood what is required to collect aerial imagery using drones, the site mapping exercise and the use of drones has been discussed with the various affected stakeholders, a risk-benefit assessment has been conducted and approvals and permissions has been received from relevant actors, you are ready to start planning the flight. 

## Obtaining a drone kit 

::: {.callout-note}
## Note for IOM staff
On request, the Global CCCM team in Geneva can coordinate, with the support of the site mapping team, the deployment of a drone kit located at IOM HQ. 
IOM staff can reach out to CCCM Support [globalcccm@iom.int](globalcccm@iom.int) with a brief description of the site mapping exercise and the intended use of the site maps, as well as the risk-benefit assessment and approval from IOM LEG colleagues. If and when available, the drone kit will then be sent with staff deployments or shipped to the requesting mission.

## Pre-flight

Go through the [Humanitarian UAV Network | Operational Check List](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1av3GvsAQOxttCXKAgYCBf8tpv8lU72P1u4voAQrhTNw/edit).

### Path and image overlap
A minimum of 16-31 images are needed to create an orthophoto from drone captured imagery with WebODM. Images should averlap by 70-72%. 

- Minimum number of images captured: 16-32
- Minimum image overlap: 70-72%
- Minimum image overlap for 3D: 83%

## Post-Flight processing

Drone captured images then need to be stitched together into one image or _orthomosaic_. 
Here we recommend using WedODM and take you through software installation, creating a new project, uploading the images, creating a task, and downloading the orthomosaic. 

### Orthomosaics with WebODM
To install WedODM manually, follow the steps outlined [here](https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/WebODM/#getting-started). 

Create a new project, upload drone captured images to create a task and download the orthomosaic. After the task ahs been successfully processed, select orthophoto.tif in the list of available
