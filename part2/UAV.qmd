# Using UAV imagery
After conducting a risk-benefit assessment and consing collect aerial imagery using drones, the following section outlines the steps for engaging with the community, obtaining a drone kit, planning and carrying out the flight and processing the capture images. 

## Obtaining a drone kit 

## Pre-flight

Go through the [Humanitarian UAV Network | Operational Check List](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1av3GvsAQOxttCXKAgYCBf8tpv8lU72P1u4voAQrhTNw/edit).

### Flight plan, nadir vs oblique images

### Ground control points

### Community engagement
### Path and image overlap
A minimum of 16-31 images are needed to create an orthophoto from drone captured imagery with WebODM. Images should averlap by 70-72%. 

- Minimum number of images captured: 16-32
- Minimum image overlap: 70-72%
- Minimum image overlap for 3D: 83%

## Post-Flight processing

Drone captured images then need to be stitched together into one image or _orthomosaic_. 
Here we recommend using WedODM and take you through software installation, creating a new project, uploading the images, creating a task, and downloading the orthomosaic. 

### Orthomosaics with WebODM
To install WedODM manually, follow the steps outlined [here](https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/WebODM/#getting-started). 

Create a new project, upload drone captured images to create a task and download the orthomosaic. After the task ahs been successfully processed, select orthophoto.tif in the list of available
