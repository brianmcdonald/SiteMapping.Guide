# UAV imagery

Once you have understood what is required to collect aerial imagery using drones, the site mapping exercise and the use of drones has been discussed with the various affected stakeholders, a risk-benefit assessment has been conducted and approvals and permissions has been received from relevant actors, you are ready to start planning the flight. 

## Obtaining a drone kit 

::: {.callout-note}
## Note for IOM staff
On request, the Global CCCM team in Geneva can coordinate, with the support of the site mapping team, the deployment of a drone kit located at IOM HQ. 
IOM staff can reach out to CCCM Support [globalcccm@iom.int](globalcccm@iom.int) with a brief description of the site mapping exercise and the intended use of the site maps, as well as the risk-benefit assessment and approval from IOM LEG colleagues. If and when available, the drone kit will then be sent with staff deployments or shipped to the requesting mission. 
:::

Online courses are available to accompany first-time drone users such as displacement site planner Andrea Cippa's 5-part tutorial on mapping with drones available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0qAu2IGhaY).

## Note for IOM staff
IOM staff planning on using the CCCM deployable drone kit should complete the following online course and present confirmation of completion upon requesting the kit.

## Pre-flight
Prior to the flight, consider the following: [^footnote4]

- **Weather:** Most drones are not waterproof and therefor it is important to check precipitation forecasts in the flight area of interest. Wind speed also has an adverse effect on drone flight. Both type and size influence the susceptibility of drones to wind. Smaller drones, such as the DJI Mavic Mini for instance, have a windspeed operating ceiling of approximately 18km/h. Clouds, if above the flight altitude can have a positive affect as they act as a giant soft-box scattering sunlight, but if they are rolling may cause inconsistencies with light exposure. If possible, it's best to fly around the middle of the day, when the sun is overhead, to limit shadows in the imagery.

- **Stakeholder engagement:** Assuming regulatory processes have already been followed. Its important that the population in the site area of interest is fully informed and understands the plannedactivity, that there is acceptance of the activity and that theres a communication channel in place for the community to voice any complaints or feedback.

- **Hardware checks:** Make sure that all batteries are charged and that all required equiments is functioning.

- **Pre-identify takeoff and landing sites:** A suitable area will be free of obstructions such as trees or overhead wires and away from move foot or road traffic.

- **Create a flight plan:** This includes the planned route, with altitude, overlap and takeoff/landing areas pre-programmed.

### Nadir vs oblique images

The image captured when a drones camera faces directly down is called a *nadir* image. For creating an orthomosaic of a site, nadir images are preferred to oblique images which are more suited to tasks such as 3D modelling.

### Ground control points

Ground control points are marks created on the site as reference points to match specific points on the image to specific coordinates within the site. They provide a great degree of accuracy for the image that relying on the GPS of the drone by itself. 

Use a minimum of 3 GCPs and capture the coordinates of each GCP centrepoint with a  Phone or handheld GPS for an accuracy level of 1-3 metres. For accuracy of 1cm a specialised [Real-time kinematic positioning (RTK)](https://emlid.com/gcps-for-drone-mapping/) kit is required.

### Path and image overlap
A minimum of 16-31 images are needed to create an orthophoto from drone captured imagery with WebODM. Images should averlap by 70-72%. 

- Minimum number of images captured: 16-32
- Minimum image overlap: 70-72%
- Minimum image overlap for 3D: 83%

### Flight altitude
Ground Sampling Distance (GSD) refers to geographic area represented by one pixel of an image. It reflects the resolution of the image, with flight height and image sensor resolution being the two biggest determining factors. For site mapping a GSD of 2.5cm2 - 1cm2 is the range most suitable. Most flight planning software automatically calculate the GSD based on an entered flight altitude. The flight altitude should also consider potential flight obstructions such as trees or overhead power lines, noise and also privacy as having a flight altitude and GSD that is too low could result in the unintended consequence of capturing information that could be personally identifiable.

[![GSD is the amount of actual ground captured by the distance between the center point of two adjacent pixels.<br> *Source: wintra.com*](/part2/images/gsd.png){width=50%}](/part2/images/gsd.png)

## Post-Flight
Following the flight, make sure to check the imagery quality and completeness, safely storge the equipment and ensure the data captured is securely stored.

## Post-Flight processing: Creating Orthomosaic

Drone captured images then need to be stitched together into one image or *orthomosaic*. 

WebODM is a free software that can be used to create orthomosaics from drone captured-imagery. To install WedODM manually, follow the steps outlined [here](https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/WebODM/#getting-started). Once installed, create a new 
project.Upload the images to create a task. After the task has been successfully completed, the orthomosaic will be ready to download. Select *orthophoto.tif* in the list of available formats and the single image output will download. 

In addition to creating orthomosaics, WebODM can also produce Digital Surface Models or 3D models of the site.
