# Introduction to satellite imagery

## Types of satellite imagery
There are different types of satellite imagery. The types of imagery generated from a satellite depends on the kind of image-capturing method (remote sensing technology) it uses: active or passive sensors. Active sensors emit radiation towards the Earth's surface and collect the reflected radiation. Lidar and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) are both example of active sensors, SAR emitting electromagnetic pulses and Lidar emitting light pulses towards the Earth surface and measuring the reflection. Passive (or Optical) sensors detect radiation naturally reflected from the Earth's surface and is dependent on the day-night cycle. 

## Cloud cover

Passive satellites are not able to capture through clouds and therefore can be limited when observing certain areas with dense cloud coverage. 

## Understanding spatial resolution
Resolution of an image is categorized as follows:
- High resolution: 30cm-5m/pixel
- Medium resolution: 10-30m/pixel
- Low resolution: over 60m/pixel

10m resolution means that each pixel represents a 10m x 10m area on the ground.The smaller the spatial resolution, the higher the level of detail. 

Depending on the users needs, different image resolutions are used.

Low to Medium resolution images are good for understanding the bigger picture, whether that is looking at historical trends or deriving insights from spectral analysis. For example, ESA's Sentinel and NASA/USGS Landsat data provide historical data at this resolution. 

High resolution images are ideal for small scale analysis or monitoring since often a smaller area if covered. The level of detail at such spatial resolution allows from small and individual objects to be identified which makes it ideal for humanitarian aid applications, detailed mapping, urban planning, as well as infrastructure, forestry and agriculture monitoring. However, high-resolution imagery is expensive and as a result less of it is openly accessible.For the purposes of creating site maps, high resolution imagery is preferable. 

# Existing imagery

Some free data sources for low to medium resolution imagery include USGS/NASA's Landsat and ESA's Sentinel series. 

High resolution Satellite imagery can be requested from IOM DTM. 

Alternatively, OpenAerialMap provides access to openly licensed aerial imagery. Imagery can be downloaded as a .tiff image file for free. However, in some cases, imagery for your area of interest may not be available. In this case, you may need to capture your own imagery.
