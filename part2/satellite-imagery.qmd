# Using satellite imagery
The choice of using satellite imagery, instead of capturing aerial imagery using drones, may be due to the need for rapid mapping turnaround time, lack of direct access to the area of interest or limitations to flying a drone listed in the previous chapter.

This section introduces the different types of satellite imagery, what to consider when choosing imagery most appropriate for your use case and where to source the imagery.

## Types of satellite imagery
There are different types of satellite imagery. The types of imagery generated from a satellite depends on the kind of image-capturing method (remote sensing technology) it uses: active or passive sensors. Active sensors emit radiation towards the Earth's surface and collect the reflected radiation. Lidar and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) are both example of active sensors. SAR emits electromagnetic pulses whereas Lidar emits light pulses towards the Earth surface, both measuring the reflection. Passive (or Optical) sensors detect radiation naturally reflected from the Earth's surface and are dependent on the day-night cycle. 

For the purpose of site mapping optical sources, which typically produce imagery with colour reprduction similar to the human eye, are most prevalent and useful.

## Cloud cover

Passive satellites are not able to capture through clouds and therefore can be limited when observing certain areas with dense cloud coverage.

## Spatial resolution
Resolution of an image is categorized as follows:
- High resolution: 30cm-5m/pixel
- Medium resolution: 10-30m/pixel
- Low resolution: over 60m/pixel

10m resolution means that each pixel represents a 10m x 10m area on the ground.The smaller the spatial resolution, the higher the level of detail. 

Depending on the users needs, different image resolutions are used.

Low to Medium resolution images are good for understanding the bigger picture, whether that is looking at historical trends or deriving insights from spectral analysis. For example, ESA's Sentinel and NASA/USGS Landsat data provide historical data at this resolution. 

High resolution images are ideal for small scale analysis or monitoring since often a smaller area if covered. The level of detail at such spatial resolution allows from small and individual objects to be identified which makes it ideal for humanitarian aid applications, detailed mapping, urban planning, as well as infrastructure, forestry and agriculture monitoring. However, high-resolution imagery is expensive and as a result less of it is openly accessible.For the purposes of creating site maps, high resolution imagery is preferable.

## Imagery sources

Some free data sources for low to medium resolution imagery include USGS/NASA's [Landsat](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/) and [ESA's Sentinel series](https://apps.sentinel-hub.com/eo-browser/). 

High-resolution imagery can be sourced from [UNOSAT](https://smcs.unosat.org/home) Some satellite image providers also provide imagery for certain select disasters. An example of this is [Maxar's Opend Data Program](https://www.maxar.com/open-data). [OpenAerialMap](https://openaerialmap.org/) can also be a useful source, where open licenced aerial imagery is made available for download.
