Welcome to *SiteMapping.Guide*, an online guidance for the production of site maps in humanitarian response. Site maps are a key resource at all stages of a camp lifecycle; from site planning on empty or partially settled land; to the coordination and management of services on a site; the development and improvement of a sites' infrastructure; to the site closure/handover/decommissioning stage. The aim of this guidance is fourfold:
- Open up the process of producing site maps to a wider of humanitarian actors and profiles, to mainstream site mapping skills, reducing reliance on a limited pool of specialized profiles.
- Increasing the speed in which site maps are produced. A shorter lead time for site map creation, means improved usefulness to planning activities and to coordination of partners in site, especially in sudden onset contexts.
- Scaling the availability of site maps, to bring their benefits to a wider number of site in responses as well as a wider number of countries.
- Encouraging the creation of consistent site map products, in terms of visuals, quality and process that are affected population-centric and that adhere to data responsibility and safeguarding standards.

## What is a Site Map?
While no strict definition of a site map exist, this guidance considers site maps to be physical or electronic maps of IDP displacement sites that uses imagery (aerial or satellite), along with the tracing and labelling of infrastructure (current or planned) as a tool for planning, coordination and risk analysis.

Infographics or maps, which focus on needs or activity/output-level indicators are, for the purpose of this document, are considered as Site Profiles rather than Site Maps and are out scope for this guide.

## Audience
This guide is for any Camp Coordination Camp Management, Shelter, or assessment actor, working in humanitarian contexts, requiring site maps to do site planning, camp coordination or risk analysis work at either agency or inter-agency level. While some prior familiarity with GIS software is beneficial for those who plan to use this guide, it is not a prerequisite. We hope that the steps documented in the below chapters, is sufficient in detail and explanation for first-time users.

## When and how can site maps be used
Regardless of this guide, producing Site Maps requires a significant investment of personnel, time, software and hardware. In addition to these, the political/security/conflict context of the area, as well community acceptance and regulatory framework are factors to consider in whether or not its feasible to develop site maps in your context and if so, what approaches are feasible. Chapter 1 details criteria to use when decided if and what approach to use, in site map development.

## Acknowledgments
This guide was developed by IOM, with considerable, inputs, support and feedback by many experts in fields such as site planning, GIS, CCCM and GBV. Financial support for this guide was generously provided by United States Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (BPRM) through the Safe From the Start Initiative. A full list of names of those who contributed or support to this guide can be found in the acknowledgements annex.

## Feedback
Many of the approaches and software/hardware tools are quickly evolving and improving. As such, we consider this guide to be a living document. If you have any suggestions on how we can improve this guide, please reach out to majones@iom.int and bmcdonald@iom.int.
