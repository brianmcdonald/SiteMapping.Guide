Welcome to *SiteMapping.Guide*, an online guidance for the production of site maps in humanitarian response. Site maps are a key resource at all stages of a camp lifecycle; from site planning on empty or partially settled land; to the coordination and management of services on a site; the development and improvement of a sites' infrastructure; to the site closure/handover/decommissioning stage. The aim of this guidance is fourfold:
- Open up the process of producing site maps to a wider of humanitarian actors and profiles, to mainstream site mapping skills, reducing reliance on a limited pool of specialized profiles.
- Increasing the speed in which site maps are produced. A shorter lead time for site map creation, means improved usefulness to planning activities and to coordination of partners in site, especially in sudden onset contexts.
- Scaling the availability of site maps, to bring their benefits to a wider number of site in responses as well as a wider number of countries.
- Encouraging the creation of consistent site map products, in terms of visuals, quality and process that are affected population-centric and that adhere to data responsibility and safeguarding standards.

## What a site map is and isn't
While no strict definition of a site map exist, this guidance considers site maps to be physical or electronic maps of IDP displacement sites that uses imagery (aerial or satellite), along with the tracing and labelling of infrastructure (current or planned) as a tool for planning and coordination.
