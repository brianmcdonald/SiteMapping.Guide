The types of imagery generated from a satellite depends on the kind of image-capturing method (remote sensing technology) it uses: active or passive sensors. Active sensors emit radiation towards the Earth's surface and collect the reflected radiation. Lidar and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) are both example of active sensors, SAR emitting electromagnetic pulses and Lidar emitting light pulses towards the Earth surface and measuring the reflection. Passive (or Optical) sensors detect radiation naturally reflected from the Earth's surface and is dependent on the day-night cycle. \n\n## Cloud cover\n\nPassive satellites are not able to capture through clouds and therefore can be limited when observing certain areas with dense cloud coverage. \n\n## Understanding spatial resolution\nResolution of an image is categorized as follows:\nHigh resolution: 30cm-5m/pixel\nMedium resolution: 10-30m/pixel\nLow resolution: over 60m/pixel\n\n10m resolution means that each pixel represents a 10m x 10m area on the ground.The smaller the spatial resolution, the higher the level of detail. \n\nDepending on the users needs, different image resolutions are used.\n\nLow to Medium resolution images are good for understanding the bigger picture, whether that is looking at historical trends or deriving insights from spectral analysis. For example, ESA's Sentinel and NASA/USGS Landsat data provide historical data at this resolution. \n\nHigh resolution images are ideal for small scale analysis or monitoring since often a smaller area if covered. The level of detail at such spatial resolution allows from small and individual objects to be identified which makes it ideal for humanitarian aid applications, detailed mapping, urban planning, as well as infrastructure, forestry and agriculture monitoring. However, high-resolution imagery is expensive and as a result less of it is openly accessible.For the purposes of creating site maps, high resolution imagery is preferable. \n\n# Existing imagery\n\nSome free data sources for low to medium resolution imagery include USGS/NASA's Landsat and ESA's Sentinel series. \n\nHigh resolution Satellite imagery can be requested from IOM DTM. \n\nAlternatively, OpenAerialMap provides access to openly licensed aerial imagery. Imagery can be downloaded as a .tiff image file for free. However, in some cases, imagery for your area of interest may not be available. In this case, you may need to capture your own imagery. \n\n\n \n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":true,"link-external-newwindow":true,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"existing-imagery.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.251","comments":{"hypothesis":true},"bibliography":["../references.bib"],"theme":"cosmo"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"existing-imagery.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"comments":{"hypothesis":true},"bibliography":["../references.bib"],"documentclass":"scrreprt","papersize":"A4"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
