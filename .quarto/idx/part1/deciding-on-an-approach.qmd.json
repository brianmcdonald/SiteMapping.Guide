The main differerence between the two is in how aerial imagery is obtained:\n1. Using high-resolution satellite imagery.\n2. Using drones to capture aerial images of the site.\n\nEach of these approaches have pros and cons and it is important to evaluate each approach against the following criteria before assessing which approach to take in your context:\n\n### Conflict and Data Sensitivity concerns\nThere are key considerations to take into account when collecting, processing and sharing any type of data. These considerations determine the degree of sensitivity applied throughout the data life cycle and include:\n\n- the potential to harm data subjects and others;\n\n- the potential to discriminate;\n\n- the potential to harm IOM staff and individuals representing authorized third parties. \n\nIn addition to the data risks and concerns outlined in the [IOM Data Protection Manual](https://publications.iom.int/books/iom-data-protection-manual), there are additional specific concerns and risks associated with the use of drones. \n\nDue to protection risks, humanitarian use of drones in conflict settings is strongly discouraged. The term \"dual-use technology\" is commonly used to describe a technology with both civilian and military applications. With the rise of the use of drones for military use, there is a risk that the use of drones for humanitarian purposes in sites may be perceived as a security threat by the site population or cause trauma due to an association of drones with their military uses. In conflict settings armed actors or authorities are likely to perceive the flying of drones as both a security and informational risk. This may mean that importation of equipment or flight approvals are not likely to be granted, or that their use in a site risk being perceived as a security threat. Your flight area must be specified prior to commencing the use of the drones. If unsure about your area of interest, please contact DOE for further guidance.\n\nOnce your flight area is identified, a risk-benefit assessment should be conducted prior to using drones. The risk-benefit assessment will evaluate the risks and benefits associated with collecting and processing drone captured imagery and determine whether flying a drone to collect aerial imagery data is the best approach for your context.\n\n### Data security/responsibility\nThe use of drones to capture aerial image for site mapping does not require the collection of personal data. Individuals must not be identifiable from captured images. Ensure that the flight (altitude, angle etc.) eliminates or reduces as much as possible the likelihood that imagery captured may directly or indirectly identify an individual. If, by mistake, you collect images in which people can be identified, you should immidiately delete them. However, if the image taken must really be used, you can either crop the image or blur the faces of people who could be identified. While collecting the data or shortly thereafter, you should check whether some of the data collected is particularly sensitive and should be deleted or otherwise made unrecognizable in the image (e.g. a group of individuals that could be identified as part of a specific group, image of illegal crops or settlement).\n\n### Regulatory environment\nIn many contexts, permissions to fly Drones is required. In some cases, a remote pilot license many also be needed. \n\n- Add [Global Drone Regulations Database](https://droneregulations.info/)\n\n### Information needs\n\nIt is important to be clear on what images you want to collect and for which specific purpose. Consider whether you only need an image/orthomosaic or a Digital Elevation Model, #D model, NDVI index etc. as this will affect your flight plan. Think about whether you have any applications outside of site mapping such as drainage analysis, slope analysis, landslide risk analysis, vegetation cover analysis etc. Consider also what area needs to be covered, bearing in mind that larger areas require longer flight times, more storage etc. You should not be flying the drone above as many areas as possible to collect as many images as possible and then decide what to do with them. The data collection must be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose (only the needed data is collected). \n\n### Organizational requirements and final checklist\n\nOnce you have completed a risk-benefit assessment, identified your flight area, sought permission from local authorites and the affected communities have been informed, the below checklist should be completed and sent to [leg@iom.int](leg@iom.int) for final approval.\n\nThe following checklist aims to ensure that all ethical and data protection considerations have been addressed. Note that this is not an exhaustive list and more considerations might be needed for your specific context or organization. For IOM users, please send any questions on data protection and any data sensitivity concerns to leg@iom.int. \n\nTrainings:\nEnsure that the IOM drone operator(s) have received sufficient training to be able to fly a drone in a secure way ensuring appropriate data collection and data protee. \n\n\n| Consideration            |\n| ------------------------ |\n| **Risk-Benefit Assessment** <br><br> Have you conducted a risk-benefit assessment to determine whether flying a drone to collect aerial imagery data is the best approach for your context? Is the use of drones necessary and justified? Have you considered whether there are any associated risks for in-country IOM staff or employees of the local authorities?|\n| **Data Collected** <br><br> Are you clear about the specific purpose of the image collection? Is the imagery data relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose? <br><br> Have you taken necessary precautions and measures to ensure you are not collecting personal data? Are any individuals identifiable from the captured images?|\n| **Flight Area** <br><br> Have you clearly identified your flight area?|\n| **Technology** <br><br> Is the technology that will be used of high standards? (UAV equipment, the image data storage system used, laptop, tablets etc.) Is the equipment safe, secure and appropriate to acheive the specific purpose.|\n| **Data Transfer, Sharing and Access controls** <br><br> Do you plan to transfer any of the data to a third party outside IOM (e.g. for the third party to provide assistance or to do further analysis on the data) or share the drone captured imagery, location data, GIS files, final site maps? If so, have you contacted LEG for further advice. Additionally, have appropriate access controls been ensured? i.e. not all IOM staff should have access to the UAV's imagery and not all should have the right to edit or delete it. You may also contact ICT to coordinate, as needed, to ensure appropriate data security. \n| **Trainings** <br><br> \n| **Logos/ Branding** <br><br> The mission, in coordination with state authorities and HQ, should decide how the UAVs should be marked (e.g. IOM logo? No logo because of security considerations? Something else?)\n| **Approvals/ Permissions** <br><br> Firstly, familiarise yourself with national legislation on required permissions and approvals needed to fly drones in your area of interest. Make sure you are not in breach of that legislation. In most contexts, an approval/ permission is needed by state or provincial authorities. <br><br> Secondly, the specific communities above which the UAVs will be flyinf should be informed. This is to avoid annoyance, complaints, and mitigate any concerns or fears that may be associated with an unexpected drone presence. The people living in these communities should have information on who is flying is flying the drone and why. Ideally, they should also have IOM (or your respective organisation)'s contact details in case they have questions or wish to raise a concern. The authorities might also inform them on your behalf. <br><br> Thirdly, additional approvals might be needed from the UN or by ICAO depending on your context.|\n\n\n...
